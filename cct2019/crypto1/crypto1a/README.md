## Solution


Original String:
```

Best option here seemed ceaser cipher, but because of all the symbols it fucked up, so instead I tried some online tools to check what else it could be, which led me to "Keyboard Change".

Keyboard Change Result (Dvorak -> QWERTY):
```
aN EASY TECHNIQUE FOR SOLVING cAESAR SUBSTITUTION CIPHERS WILL ONLY GET YOU SO FAR BECAUSE OF PUNCTUATION SYMBOLS>  sTILL< IT SHOULD GET YOU CLOSE ENOUGH TO FIGURE OUT THE REST>  bUT CAN YOU FIGURE OUT THE KEY WHICH HAPPENS TO BE THE NAME OF THE 'LAYOUT' WHICH CREATED THIS> aCTUALLY< YOU HAD BETTER ENTER IT THRICE JUST TO BE SAFE 9ALL LOWER_CASE IF YOU PLEASE0>
```

Now I need some manual Changes to make it prettier, so I changed the following:

|OG|NEW|
|:-:|:-:|
|>|.|
|<|,|
|9|(|
|0|)|

I also switched the lower and upper cases.

Manually Modified String:
```
An easy technique for solving Caesar substitution ciphers will only get you so far because of punctuation symbols.  Still, it should get you close enough to figure out the rest.  But can you figure out the key which happens to be the name of the "layout" which created this. Actually, you had better enter it thrice just to be safe (all lower-case if you please).
```

And so here I knew the password to `crypto1a.zip` was 'dvorakdvorakdvorak'.

unzipping the file revealed the flag!
